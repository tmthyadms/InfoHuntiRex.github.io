# Infohunt eQuiz
Infohunt eQuiz is a simple website designed to facilitate the second checkpoint of the _MSU iReX 14.0 InfoHunt Challenge_, which presents users with a quiz consisting of 10 questions based on the selected final year's project. It is to test participants' knowledge and understanding of the chosen project. To proceed to the next checkpoint, users must answer all questions correctly.

The website is built using HTML, CSS, along with the Bootstrap framework for the front-end design, while JavaScript is used for the back-end logic to validate the answers.
